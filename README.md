## Description:
The README Generator was created in effort to easily generate README files that use a consistent format for my future projects. Please make sure to review Visual Presentation. 
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
WHEN I enter my project title THEN this is displayed as the title of the README.
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options THEN a badge and link for that license are added near the license.
WHEN I enter my GitHub link THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions.
WHEN I enter my email address THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
